<!--
Thanks for opening a PR! Please fill in the sections below.
A few quick notes:
  - Squash-merged into main, so the PR title becomes the merge commit message.
  - CI runs npm test on every push.
  - Conventional commit prefix in the title: feat / fix / chore / docs / test.
    Add `!` (e.g. feat!:) if the change is breaking.
